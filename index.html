    <h1>Learning and implementation</h1>
    <!-- How has this course changed your outlook on learning? What's changed? Why?
When frustration comes up how do you be with it? What's your course of action?
Why should we teach to the whole person rather than to just a skill set? What benefits are there to this method?
How do you feel about your upcoming project? What do you anticipate while working with a classmate?
What benefits will there be to work with someone else?
What challenges could come with this partnership? -->

<p>It has been pretty huge actually. I have always struggled with school, not the content just the orginazation and showing up aspect, so i never thought i was smart. Until i started boating and saw the way i could problem solve in high stress environments. I still didn’t understand that i was able to learn and excel because of the growth frame of mind, and positive and immediate reinforcement. </p>
<p>What has changed, is everything, the way i choose to spend time. The reason it has changed so drastically, is once i started coding, i like learning again. It made me realise  I subconsciously broke down problems. It made me aware and become more conscious of the process, so i can break down the the challenges in other situations (like behind a computer screen)  that aren’t as innate in my nature. Another big ah ha for me was learning how to take that structure of problem solving; the logic of it, and apply it to abstract concepts in order to make them comprehendible, and maluable.</p>
<p>As i play catch up with all my projects and still follow up preclasses i dont have time for much else. It is forcing to utilize my time wisely which is something i have always struggled with, and currently do, but the progress and the upward trend are undeniable.  I have only kayaked once in the last two weeks, and im okay with that. What i am doing here is changing my habits and the way i manuvuer life, and this will take me to financial freedom. It will be high water some where in the world if i can afford to get there! It is to the point where what i enjoy has shifted aswell. </p>
