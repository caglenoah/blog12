<p>"It has been quite a journey, to be honest. I've always struggled with school, not with the content itself, but rather with staying organized and motivated. As a result, I never considered myself to be intelligent. However, everything changed when I started boating and witnessed my ability to problem-solve in high-stress environments. It was then that I began to comprehend my capacity for learning and excelling, thanks to adopting a growth mindset and receiving positive and immediate reinforcement.

    The transformation in my life has been profound, particularly in how I choose to spend my time. The catalyst for this drastic change was my introduction to coding, which reignited my passion for learning. Coding made me realize that I naturally break down problems and become more conscious of the process, enabling me to tackle challenges in various situations, even those that are not innate to my nature, such as working behind a computer screen.
    
    Another significant revelation for me was the application of problem-solving structures and logical thinking to abstract concepts, making them more comprehensible and malleable. As I strive to catch up on my projects and attend preclasses, my time becomes a precious resource. Although time management has always been a struggle for me, I can see undeniable progress and an upward trend.
    
    Interestingly, my shift in habits and approach to life has also influenced my preferences and sources of enjoyment. Even though I've only been kayaking once in the past two weeks, I'm content with that. My focus now lies in reshaping my habits and maneuvering life in a way that will lead me to financial freedom. If I can afford to explore new kayaking destinations around the world, that will be the high watermark of my success!
    
    I must admit that I handle frustration exceptionally well. I often refer to kayaking in my examples because whitewater kayaking teaches you to remain calm in any situation. Whether it's inexperienced boaters missing eddies or having to physically maneuver 1500 lbs boats into the eddy, or enduring a swarm of mosquitoes while doing so, I refuse to let frustration seep in. Frustration alters your physical state by affecting blood flow, and in demanding situations, it can lead to injuries or loss of stamina. Mentally, frustration breaks down your thought process.
    
    In these situations, the most common response is to assign blame, triggering defensive reactions and resulting in chaos within the group. This becomes even more critical when in a leadership position. If someone doesn't listen to you due to a lack of respect and they miss an eddy, there are no more choices left. Such circumstances can unsettle people, making them feel out of control, and consequently, they might act out of control, becoming a hazard. Picture yourself 80 miles away from cell phone service, trapped in an impressive canyon. The only option is to keep navigating an unfamiliar river. As people's nerves and emotions escalate, fatigue sets in, hunger takes hold, and stress levels rise due to the highest flows witnessed in 11 years.
    
    If I allow frustration to creep in, my brain tells me that I shouldn't be in this situation. Admittedly, it's valid to question why I would put myself in such circumstances if people were better prepared or more experienced. However, that's precisely why it's crucial to maintain composure. What you emit, you receive. By remaining kind, composed, and actively working toward solutions while effectively communicating, you shape the experience for yourself and others, even if the outcome is failure. It becomes a positive experience, as long as you can keep the group on track and relaxed. What you remember isn't the stress but the accomplishmentâ€”the remarkable ability of strangers at the start of a trip to work together</p>
